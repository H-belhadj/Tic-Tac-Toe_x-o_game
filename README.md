# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) game implemented in Python.

## How to Play

1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```

3. **Run** the game by executing the following command:
   ```
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

4. The game will start, and the board will be displayed. Each player will take turns entering their moves.

5. **Enter your move** by specifying a number from 1 to 9, representing the positions on the board. For example, entering "5" would place your symbol in the center of the board.

6. The game will continue until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The winner will be displayed, or a draw message will be shown.
